# This wrapper script is intended to be submitted to LSF to support
# communicating jobs.
#
# This script uses the following environment variables set by the submit MATLAB code:
# PARALLEL_SERVER_CMR         - the value of ClusterMatlabRoot (may be empty)
# PARALLEL_SERVER_MATLAB_EXE  - the MATLAB executable to use
# PARALLEL_SERVER_MATLAB_ARGS - the MATLAB args to use
# PARALLEL_SERVER_TOTAL_TASKS - total number of workers to start
# PARALLEL_SERVER_NUM_THREADS - number of cores needed per worker
# PARALLEL_SERVER_DEBUG       - used to debug problems on the cluster
#
# The following environment variables are forwarded through mpiexec:
# PARALLEL_SERVER_DECODE_FUNCTION     - the decode function to use
# PARALLEL_SERVER_STORAGE_LOCATION    - used by decode function
# PARALLEL_SERVER_STORAGE_CONSTRUCTOR - used by decode function
# PARALLEL_SERVER_JOB_LOCATION        - used by decode function
#
# The following environment variables are set by LSF:
# LSB_MCPU_HOSTS - list of hostnames with their associated number of processors allocated to this LSF job

# If PARALLEL_SERVER_ environment variables are not set, assign any
# available values with form MDCE_ for backwards compatibility
